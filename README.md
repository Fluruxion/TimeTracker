# TimeTracker by Fluruxion
Tracks timings for tasks and saves them to a CSV

# Description

This is a personal use application designed to track hours spent working on various tasks.
These tasks can be exported to a .CSV file laid out to present information on my work done during any desired period.
As of writing this, I am actively using this application to provide my employer with accurate timesheets to represent my work done during part-time employment.

Features and design choices are likely to represent requirements for my current role.

# Current features include:
- Record time taken for tasks
  - Save tasks with a name and comment
  - Pause ongoing task
  - Timer shows current hours and minutes taken on ongoing task
- Edit logged task hours (Opens popup window to make quick changes)
- Continue logged task to resume tracking time taken
- Delete logged task
- Mark logged tasks as having taken place during full established workday to automatically generate a task containing the remainder of the day's hours
  - Marked tasks then have their comments edited to make this clear. This is added on the end, existing comment remains.
- Count shows the total time taken for all logged tasks
- Save all logged tasks as a timesheet in CSV file format
- Open existing timesheet.csv
