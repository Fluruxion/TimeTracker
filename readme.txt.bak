TimeTracker
###########

This is a personal use application designed to track hours spent working on various tasks.
These tasks can be exported to a .CSV file laid out to present information on my work done during any desired period.
As of writing this readme, I am actively using this application to provide my employer with accurate timesheets to represent my work done during part-time employment.
